I've learned the basics of html and css, while coding on codepen.io. Given I need to look at codes to jog my memory still, but im driven to learn more, and to be able to get a career out of this someday. I havent learned nearly enough yet to consider my self good, but id like to think this is the norm for anybody attempting to learn how to code. I have demonstrated I can design a basic website, I can add forms, buttons, styles, colors, move around text, add images, add video, and things of that sort. As i stated though, I still have much to learn in order to become a competant coder, and I am excited to see where this goes.
